### Product perspective 
  * The final product consists of a billing system, which will be responsible for making quotations and once approved they can be invoiced. Taking into account that you can also make high losses and changes of products, but mainly of customers and suppliers because the company does not have physical inventory so the inventory of products is not the most important.

#### Product functions 
  * Generation of quotes
  * Generation of invoices
  * High losses and customer modifications
  * High losses and modifications of suppliers and products
  * Sales inquiry by invoice
  * Generation of users / employees
  * Profit consultation

  ### Elicitation process


Key points of the interview

* On April 24 we met with the owner of the company Mr. Víctor Fraire to talk about the system he is requesting and he explained the process of the company.
* The company has a main process, it is dedicated to the sale of MRO products for maquiladoras. The main process begins in the maquiladora, where the requisitor has a request for material and passes it to the purchasing department, the purchasing department makes a request for quotation and sends it to the vendor of the company for the realization of the quotation and send it to the department of purchases of return, once the department of purchases receives the quotation and approves it happens to realize the order of purchase that will be sent to the seller of the company.
With the purchase order, the seller can generate the invoice of the desired material that must be approved by the company administrator.
* Once the invoices have been generated, the administrator is responsible for generating the procurement reports, grouped by suppliers to give to the driver and he is responsible for making the purchases of the material and deliver it to the maquiladora. Once the material is delivered, the main process of the company ends.

* In addition to the owner of the company explaining the process of the company also provided us with some points of what you want the system to do and explained below

• The system must have an administrator. A user is defined for each employee.

• The system must have two principles processes that are:
###### Quote
Each user can quote and within the quote.
- Quotation number
- client
- Product description (Supplier, part number, name, cost, amount and note)
- Percentage of profit
- Option to print
- Option to export in PDF

###### Bill
Each user can generate invoices that will be subsequently approved by the administrator, the invoice will also have the following characteristics:
- Quotation number to invoice
- Edit article
- Select the products of the quote that will be made for production.
- Complete to send the invoice to the administrator to approve it

• The system must be able to store customers, suppliers and products.
- For each case of customers and suppliers.
- For the case of the products, the Name, the description, the cost and the part number must be stored. It should be noted that the products are not so important that there is no physical inventory, that the company only buys the products it will sell, but this option is required for future possibilities.

• The administrator will be able to generate reports of the sales according to the invoiced by each employee
• The administrator can generate a route report.
  - The trip report is a report that groups the purchases made by the billed products, grouped by supplier. This report is generated for the driver and delivery person
